# Stock-Prediction
Scrape historical stock data using speech recognition and applying machine learning models for stock prediction.
I have used python programming language for my research, In this I wrote a python script which would download the historical data of stock which user has spoken after running the "voice 2.7.py".
The script will scrape the data from yahoo finance site from it's first stock in the market to the current time and date the program has run.
Later I have applied LSTM, ARIMA and Facebook prophet models for predicting the stock data.It turn's out LSTM model error rate was quite low compare to other time series models.
Please fill free to comment on my work.
